<p class="first">Three hundred years ago Pèro Veribest, Jesuit priest at the court of Kang Hsi, cast
a number of bronze astronomical instruments for his imperial patron. The apparatus,

the care it has received has been so faithful that one would hardly imagine that this
dragon was cast more than three centuries ago. </p>

This temple stands near two of China’s most sacred shrines, the sites of the birthplace

<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The subject of this little book is of general interest to people who are acquainted
with things Chinese. The dragon has played a large part in Chinese thought through
four thousand and more years. Even in these days of the Republic it still fills an
important place in Chinese life.
</p>
<p>The dragon is one of the most common ornamental designs in China and one meets it
wherever one goes in this country. However, in spite of the significance attached
to the dragon, very little has ever been written concerning it in either Chinese or
English. Only a few general articles on this subject have been published in magazines,
and the references to it in books are very brief. No independent study of the dragon
in book form has been made in either of these two languages until now.
</p>
<p>The author is peculiarly fitted to undertake this piece of work. He was born in China
and speaks the Chinese language as a native. Thus he has had the first-hand knowledge
and the language to help him in his study. He has been studying on the subject of
the dragon for fourteen years. In this time he has traveled over more than one half
the number of provinces of China. The study is therefore not the result of a few month’s
investigation, nor is it the product of research in only one city or province. The
author’s acquaintance with the people and the language of China have made it possible
for him to go to original sources and to study the subject from every angle.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.viii">[<a href="#pb.viii">viii</a>]</span></p>
<p>Perhaps the last word on the Chinese dragon is not yet said, nevertheless it is safe
to say that this treatise is as complete as our present knowledge will permit. This
little volume should be of value to all who are interested in China.
</p>
<p>This account of the dragon will not only be of value to foreigners, but it will also
be such to Chinese. The author has made this study a hobby for many years and the
result of his research is a splendid contribution to the literature on China. It would
be a good idea for more people to take up the study of other phases of Chinese life
in the same way and thus help to interpret China to the West.

<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the spring of 1909 the writer had the honor of being a guest for a week in the
summer home of Dr. W.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;P. Martin, near Peking. Many residents of the Capital during
the decade preceding the Revolution, and for a number of years before that, knew “Pearl
Grotto” and visited the venerable senior missionary of China, then lately retired
from the Presidency of the Imperial Tung Wen College.
</p>
<p>Dr. Martin was a scholar of the old school and enjoyed few pursuits better than that
of reviewing his remarkable memory of the classical writers. During the meals the
old gentleman, then nearly eighty, would quote readily from Homer, Horace, and Virgil,
and would ask his guest to translate the passages freely into English and to cite
the books and chapters quoted.
</p>
<p>After a few days in this uncomfortable situation the guest began to cast about for
some means of relief. At that time he had been in the country but a few months, and
was just beginning a general study of Chinese art. The dragon, among other objects
of interest, particularly attracted his attention. It occurred to him to ask Dr. Martin
some questions about this creature whose form was so popular with the Chinese. Accordingly
a carefully prepared list of six or seven questions about the dragon was launched
one morning across the breakfast table before the attack of Greek and Latin began.
The first question met with a noncommittal reply, the second fared little better,
and so on to the end. Then Dr. Martin admitted that this <span class="pageNum" id="pb.x">[<a href="#pb.x">x</a>]</span>was one of the subjects about which he knew very little. He was, however, very warm
in his desire to help find answers to these questions, and he referred his guest to
his personal friend, Sir Robert Hart, the Inspector General of the Imperial Customs,
who had also lived fifty years in China. Unfortunately Sir Robert’s replies were as
vague as those of the retired Professor. The questions which were asked of these two
eminent Sinologues were also submitted to several other British and Americans in Peking,
and later to many Chinese, but with similar results.
</p>
<p>It soon became evident that if the searcher for light on “Things Chinese” were to
learn much about this creature which had challenged his attention, he must look it
up from original sources. He was later convinced of this fact when he found it impossible
to secure any satisfactory information from books published in English. He then resolved
that before he himself was fifteen years in the country he would have answers to the
seven questions which he had asked of his friends in Peking. The contents of this
brochure are the results of a study made in ten provinces of China over a period of
fourteen years. While this volume is not offered as the final word upon this subject,
it probably represents the most exhaustive study thus far given to the Chinese dragon.
</p>
<p>This book is not intended primarily for <span class="corr" id="xd31e193" title="Source: sinologues">Sinologues</span> and it contains no Chinese characters. The volume is written for the average reader,
who in his study of things Chinese, has little time to go to original sources. Most
people do not wish to be burdened with long quotations to prove abstract hypotheses
or to have Chinese characters inserted in the text repeatedly to break the sequence.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xi">[<a href="#pb.xi">xi</a>]</span></p>
<p>If later interest in this subject justifies it, a larger work will be attempted and
a more detailed presentation of the material thus far collected will be made. The
writer’s purpose in this book has been to make as clear a statement of the subject
as could be done within the compass of a small book, without introducing unnecessary
material. If he has succeeded in this endeavor, he will be more than gratified.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER ONE</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE PLACE OF THE DRAGON IN CHINESE LIFE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are real dragons living in China to-day. These are not the horrible monsters
that some have imagined them to be. They are friendly creatures highly revered by
all the people. They possess marvelous powers and they occasionally permit themselves
to be seen by mortal eyes. Such is the belief of at least seven out of every ten Chinese.
</p>
<p>The popular belief in the dragon is so deeply rooted and so widespread that it is
advisable for one to secure an accurate knowledge of the Chinese idea of the venerated
saurian if he desires to gain a truly sympathetic understanding of this remarkable
people. Nearly every phase of Chinese life bears evidence of the influence of this
unique member of the animal kingdom. Particularly is this true in the realms of their
art, literature, folklore, zoölogy, history, and religion.
</p>
<p>Chinese art employs dragon designs in endless variety. The graceful lines of its symmetrically
proportioned body are found in every part of the country painted upon silks and porcelain,
woven <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>into brocades, carved on wood, embroidered upon satin, cast in bronze, and chiseled
upon marble. It is the most characteristically Chinese of the many Oriental designs
which are so attractive to Western students of art.
</p>
<p>The literature of the country abounds in references to this marvelous creature as
one may readily discover by even a cursory study of its books of history, poetry,
letters, medicine, and fiction.
</p>
<p>Chinese folklore is replete with countless entertaining stories of the wonderful feats
of this great animal, while an infinite number of proverbs and old folks’ sayings
bear their testimony to the almost universal belief in its existence.
</p>
<p>Popular zoölogy places the dragon next to man, at the head of the list of all living
creatures, thus occupying the position of the lion or tiger in our Western classification.
Strictly speaking, Chinese natural history gives the dragon the rank of king only
of scale-covered animals or creatures which live in the sea; the two fabulous creatures,
the Chi Ling and the Phœnix respectively, have first place above all beasts and other
animals which live upon the earth, and all birds and other creatures which fly in
the air. But because the dragon is equally at home in the air <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>and on the earth, as well as in the sea, it has been ranked as the ruler of all created
life below man.
</p>
<p>Chinese geomancy for ages has looked to the dragon as a means of determining the fates
and fortunes of the “Sons of Han.” Until very recently comparatively few Chinese would
build a house or bury a corpse without first consulting a geomancer, who would, in
one way or another, refer to its probable influence upon his action. It is, moreover,
a generally accepted belief that every twelfth hour, day, month, and year of the lunar
calendar are under the dragon’s dominating control.
</p>
<p>Chinese history records scores of appearances of the king of beasts through the four
thousand or more years since the age of the three mythical rulers. Appearances of
the dragon are connected with the stories of many prominent characters of China’s
past. Perhaps the most noteworthy reference is one which states that two dragons as
guards of honor visited the home of Confucius on the day that great sage was born.
These frequent references to the dragon are considered, for the most part, by the
majority of Chinese scholars quite as authentic as the statements about the famous
worthies themselves.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>Chinese religion places the dragon in the calendar of its deities as the God of Rain
and the Ruler of Rivers, Lakes, and Seas. As such it has been worshiped for centuries.
There are probably very few cities of any size in the whole country which, at least
until the recent revolution, were without a temple or shrine to the dragon king. This
deity was worshiped on the first and fifteenth of every month.
</p>
<p>In the opinion of the writer dwellers in other lands commonly think of the dragon
in much the same light as they think of the centaurs, of Geryon or the Minotaur of
Grecian fables: a strange mythical creature merely the product of human fancy. It
is also probable that most of them think that the majority of Chinese consider it
in the same way, but this is a mistaken conception. It may be considered a very conservative
estimate to state that at least three hundred and sixty million Chinese believe in
the actual existence of dragons as firmly as other peoples believe that there are
such animals as tigers roaming in the jungles of Bengal and such monsters as walruses
wandering over the icy stretches which border the arctic circle, though they themselves
may never have set foot upon the shores of India nor have crossed the Arctic Sea.

<p class="first">The brick upon which these dragons are molded was baked two thousand years ago. It
was dug up recently near Kaifengfu, in Honan province, one of the ancient capitals
of China. When two dragons appear in art they usually face each other. On this ancient
brick the reverse is true. The circle through which these animals have wound themselves
has become, in modern art, a disk. Most dragons are portrayed gazing intently at the
disk, which is usually described as the sun. The simplicity of these dragons is very
marked in contrast to the elaborate designs of the present day. </p>

Sea,” within the walls of the Imperial Palace in Peking. </p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>Quite recently the writer made a localized study of the universality of the belief
in dragons. One hundred representative Chinese of different ages and walks in life
in an important city were asked the following questions: Do you believe in the present
existence of the dragon? And what percentage of the people of China do you think hold
this belief? Eighty-two of the one hundred answered the first question in the affirmative.
Regarding the universality of the belief in the dragon these men estimated that at
least eighty-six and six-tenths per cent of their fellow nationals believe in its
existence. The above study bore out very accurately the writer’s estimate of the extent
of the popular belief in the dragon. His judgment was based upon questions asked many
scores of Chinese in ten different provinces of the country through a period of fourteen
years.

<h2 class="main">HOW THE DRAGON IDEA ORIGINATED</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The elaborate conception of the dragon which we find to-day in Chinese art and literature
is undoubtedly a very different animal from the one which was responsible for the
origin of the dragon idea. The fabled sea serpent, the alligator, the salamander,
and the boa constrictor have each been regarded as the prototype of this unique creature.
It is far more likely, however, that some antediluvian saurian was the true source
from which the dragon idea has sprung. Back in the dawn of history some early member
of the human race may have met with one of these monstrous creatures which paleontologists
tell us were, in some period of their development, equally at home on land and in
the sea, and because of its gigantic size and marvelous powers attributed to it a
supernatural origin. In later ages, even the unearthed skeleton of one of these monsters
might have been sufficient to have led to the inception of the story. If this theory
is correct it is easy to understand how through <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>succeeding ages the belief could have grown and how superstition and coincidence would
have done their share to elaborate from the early monster the marvelous creature of
the present day.
</p>
<p>According to the theory advanced above, the writer believes that the most probable
prototype of the dragon is the Brontosaurus of the Mesozoic age, although the present
conception of the dragon may easily have sprung from such other prehistoric animals,
as the plesiosaurus of the same period or the Iguanodon of the Cenozoic age. Skeletons
of these giants of the saurian family and pictures of the reconstructed animals indicate
a striking resemblance to the graceful creatures that dominate the art of China.
</p>
<p>The first appearance of the true dragon, according to the records of what is considered
to be authentic Chinese history, occurred some forty-six centuries ago during the
reign of Huang Ti, or Hsuan Yuan, the third of the five great rulers. We are told
that after this personage had reigned one hundred and eleven years a large dragon
appeared and took him to heaven upon his back. Since that day dragons have been seen
in every dynasty and by hundreds of witnesses, as Chinese history abundantly attests.
Dragon appearances <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>were considered auspicious, and augured well for the affairs of state. In support
of this belief, it is interesting to note that when the late President Yuan Shih-kai
was trying to make himself emperor his friends made at least one attempt to unearth
what were supposed to be the bones of a dragon. This was done in order that the superstitious
among his countrymen might be led to feel that his desire to reëstablish the empire
was according to the law of heaven.
</p>
<p>For centuries it was the custom for anyone who saw a dragon, either himself or through
the magistrate of the district in which he lived, immediately to announce the fact
to the emperor. In early days history was often counted from the appearance of a particular
dragon.
</p>
<p>A popular fable relates that Yü Wang was able to end the great flood 2297 <span class="asc">B.C.</span> only after he had succeeded in capturing the dragon, who was said to be responsible
for the deluge. The animal was chained in heavy irons and imprisoned, after which
the flood subsided. Ever since that time all dragons, we are told, have trembled at
the memory of the only man who ever conquered their kind.

<p class="first">In most Confucian and imperial temples the center of the path that leads from the
temple entrance to the sacred shrine is known as the spirit way. Where this route
leads up a staircase, one usually finds not steps but a large inclined stone on which
are carved one or more dragons. At the hour of worship the spirit of the one who is
honored, travels, we are told, over this course. The dragon monolith shown in this
photograph leads up to the smallest, the central one, of the three altars at the Temple
of Heaven in Peking. </p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER THREE</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE VARIETIES OF DRAGONS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To the majority of people the word “dragon” denotes one animal only. There are, however,
at least eight species of animals which bear this name. These are the Lung Wang, the
Shen Lung, the Li Lung, the Chiao Lung, the Ying Lung, the Chiu Lung, the Tsao Lung,
and the Tu Lung. They all belong to the genus dragon (Lung), but each has one or more
characteristics which differentiates it from the others. For example, the Li Lung,
or Chih Lung, as it is also named, has and is the only species which possesses wings.
It is, however, but one of these species, the Shen Lung, which will be considered
at this time. Of the eight varieties this is the one best known. The others may be
dismissed with a word. Dr. Williams, in his “Middle Kingdom,” mentions only three
varieties and says that these are respectively dragons of the sky, of the sea, and
of marshes. However, it seems that the Chinese are not generally accustomed to make
such a classification. They rather consider that <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>the one species, Shen Lung, controls and operates in all of these three spheres. Most
of the other varieties are minor creatures which are practically unknown and have
slight bearing upon this study. The one exception to this rule is the Lung Wang, or
dragon king. This species differs from the others in that its members possess a dragon’s
head upon a human body. By some this dragon is said to answer to Neptune in Western
mythology. Each ocean has a dragon king. The members of this species differ from those
of the one in which we are the most interested in that dragon kings rarely grow old
and never die. The remaining varieties are all quite secondary and practically never
appear in any form of art. These are mentioned only occasionally in Chinese literature.
This article will therefore be confined to an account of the Shen Lung, or spirit
dragon, the real dragon, the dragon which has held China in its spell since the days
of Yao and Shun.

<p class="first">This red lacquer tablet, inscribed with eight characters in gold, stands in the shrine
of the Provincial Temple of Chekiang at Hangchow. The inscription may be freely translated,
“The Sacred Tablet of Our Revered Teacher Confucius.” The tablet is approximately
four feet high and one foot wide. Nine dragons play hide and seek in the framework
that borders the edge of the inscription. Two larger dragons twine themselves about
the slender pillars before the shrine. These serve as guards of honor. These two creatures
symbolize the two dragons which, history says, encircled the home of Confucius when
the sage was born. Similar tablets are found in all temples to Confucius throughout
China. </p>

<p class="first">Within the main entrance to Nanking’s Examination Hall, where the Master’s Degree
was earned, stood a long “spirit wall.” Upon the front of this structure was painted
a dragon gate, beneath which was shown a carp changing into a dragon. A Bachelor of
Arts, according to China’s ancient system of education, upon becoming a Master, was
congratulated by his friends as having passed through the “Dragon Gate.” The implication
was that it was as difficult for a Bachelor of Arts to become a Master as for a carp
to be transformed into a dragon. </p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb16b">[<a href="#pb16b">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>All true dragons are of two kinds: those which are such by birth and those which become
dragons by transformation from fish of the carp species. The transformed variety become
dragons by leaping up the waters of a certain cataract upon a western mountain stream.
Large numbers of carp swim once each year, we learn, to this waterfall <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>known as the “Dragon’s Gate.” Here under the cataract they flounder about, jumping
and springing up out of the swirling waters; a few of them succeed in getting over
the falls to the higher waters above. Those which are successful in this effort become
dragons. After the story of this strange occurrence became known to the public, it
was incorporated into the life of the people in a popular saying, and scholars who
succeeded in passing the great triennial literary examinations were said to have “passed
the Dragon Gate.” The use of this figure was doubtless to illustrate the difficulty
of passing the examinations, for it implied that it was as difficult a task for a
man to succeed at these examinations as it was for the carp to leap up over the falls.
This figure has, in addition, the happy inference that even as the carp, an ordinary
fish, might become a mighty dragon, just so by this supreme effort a scholar might
become a master of arts, thus placing the value of the transformation on a very high
scale.
</p>
<p>One ancient authority tells us that there is a class of these great saurians which
are known as “lazy dragons.” These do not like to exert themselves in the task of
directing clouds which carry rain over the surface of the earth. They sometimes make
themselves small in size, drop <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>to the surface of the earth and hide in trees, under roofs of houses, and even in
the clothing of unsuspecting countrymen. The Thunder God, learning of their desertion
from their posts of duty, sends his messengers to search for them and when he discovers
their location, kills them with thunderbolts during an electric storm, after the manner
of Zeus. This explains to many an unsophisticated man the frequent destruction of
life and property during thunderstorms. An epithet that in some parts of the country
is often hurled at lazy people is “Lan Lung,” or “lazy dragon.”

<p class="first">In the city of Kaifengfu, Honan, the first capital of the Sung emperors, is a sacred
building known as the “Dragon Pavilion.” Within this structure, which stands on an
eminence high above most of the buildings of the city, is a large basaltic stone known
as the “Dragon Throne.” This is cut in the form of a cube of about six feet in each
dimension and rests to-day under the shrine of the Pearly Emperor. Nine hundred years
ago the Sung emperors doubtlessly placed their lacquered thrones upon its upper surface.
In order to protect it from vandal hands, the historic stone is now incased within
wooden walls, which form a cavelike room about it. Fourteen dragons in deep relief
surround the outer edge: five on the front and back faces, and two on either end.
Visitors must use candles in order to see at all in the inky darkness. Because of
the narrow quarters no photograph can be taken. This drawing by a Kaifengfu artist
was made under the greatest difficulties and is probably the first reproduction ever
attempted. </p>

<h2 class="main">WHAT DRAGONS REALLY LOOK LIKE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Comparatively few Chinese of the older generation seem to question the existence of
dragons or to doubt the marvelous powers usually attributed to them. In view of this
fact it is surprising to find how ignorant is the average person who holds this belief
when asked to give an accurate description of the great creature. Perhaps this is
not strange, however, when we remember that there are apparently no books which purport
to give any complete account of the dragon. The innumerable references to it in Chinese
literature largely deal with the dragon’s performances and say little about his appearance.
In order to make a satisfactory study of the dragon one must, therefore, follow a
tedious process of collecting, eliminating, and coördinating a multitude of stories,
proverbs, and incidents from history, and make a careful study of selected pictures
and carvings, and if possible secure interviews with those who profess to have seen
the great king of the animal creation.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>One writer, who is anxious to make intelligible to the average person the accepted
representation of the king of all created life below man, describes the dragon in
terms of animals with many of which we are quite familiar. He says that it has the
head of a camel, the horns of a deer, the ears of a cow, the neck of a snake, the
body of a fish, the scales of a carp, the claws of an eagle, the eyes of a devil,
and the paws of a tiger.
</p>
<p>The bodies of all dragons, we are informed, are symmetrically divided into three sections
of equal length, these divisions being from the point of the nose to the shoulders,
from the shoulders to the thighs, and from the thighs to the tip of the tail.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span></p>

<p class="first">This exquisitely wrought bronze instrument for measuring the position of the stars
may be seen in Peking. It stands at the foot of the ramp leading to the Imperial Observatory.
Three hundred years ago the Jesuit astronomer Veribest had this, and a score of other
magnificent instruments, cast for the emperor Kang Hsi. Most of these great pieces
are surmounted or protected by dragons of the finest workmanship. </p>

<p class="first">This palace portrait was a prized possession of the Manchu emperors. Yung Cheng, the
<span class="corr" id="xd31e731" title="Source: sun">son</span> of Kang Hsi, is here shown upon the throne, which he ascended in 1723. Countless
dragons disport themselves upon his costly robes of state and writhe and wreathe themselves
in the lattice structure of his imperial throne. </p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb25b">[<a href="#pb25b">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>The “Shoh Wen,” a book written during the Tang dynasty, says that the dragon has the
following marvelous powers: “It may cause itself to become visible or invisible at
will, and it can become long or short, and coarse or fine, at its own good pleasure.”
This wonderful versatility, of course, makes it difficult for us to find any recorded
statement of the maximum length of this creature, since there is no limit set for
its expansion. Another book of the Tang dynasty helps out a little, however, when
it describes a certain dragon, which was found dead, as <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>having been over one hundred feet long, while other accounts lead us to believe that
the dragon at times assumes a size several miles in length. The smallest size of which
any statement has been found was the length of a silkworm.
</p>
<p>In color, dragons are differentiated as being red, yellow, blue, white, or black.
During the Manchu dynasty, yellow was the imperial color, and the yellow or golden
dragon was designated the imperial dragon. In the preceding dynasty, the Ming dynasty,
when red was the national color, it is believed that the red dragon was proclaimed,
by decree of the emperor, the official dragon of the empire.
</p>
<p>Every careful observer in the Far East has noticed a difference in the number of claws
in the pictures of dragons—some possessing three, others four, and still others five
claws. The smallest number is found on the dragons of Japanese art. Ordinarily Chinese
dragons have four claws, while those of five were recognized as imperial dragons.
The two types of Chinese dragons, with these slight variations, are, however, one
and the same species, and are identical in every other respect. An attempt has been
made to prove that the variation of claws from three through four to five is a historic
development, but we can find no <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>conclusive proof to substantiate this theory. It is possible that the ancient dragon
designs of China have only three claws on each foot. Japan borrowed her art from China,
and it is not unlikely that at the period when she borrowed this design the Chinese
dragon was represented with only three claws.
</p>
<p>It is said of the carp that it always has exactly thirty-six scales in each row, leading
from its head to its tail. After the same manner, dragons are described as possessing
eighty-one scales in each series.
</p>
<p>The true dragon has nine sons. Each is different in appearance from the other and
each possesses his own peculiar characteristics. These children of the dragon are
the variants in appearance from the general line which we are accustomed to look for
in the dragon, and which we often see in carvings and architecture. The dragon heads
on bells, on the peak tiles of temples and palaces, on sword hilts, on monuments,
and in similar places are representations of the progeny of the God of Rain and do
not portray that god himself.

is hung. These represent one variety of the nine sons of the king of the animal world.

<h2 class="main">PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN DRAGONS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In spite of the fact that modern zoölogy has never included in the pages of its textbooks
descriptions and pictures of the dragon as a creature of reality, yet there are men
in China to-day who claim to have seen these animals, some of which have been described
very accurately. The writer has had the pleasure of conversing with several Chinese
who assert that they have seen the dragon at close range. He has also secured, at
secondhand, information from others who are said to have looked upon this most marvelous
of creatures. All of the men whom the writer interviewed were of sound mind and were
accredited by their acquaintances with being men of reliable character. There is no
reason to believe that any one of them were inebriate or under the power of hallucination
at the time they witnessed the creatures of their description.
</p>
<p>A teacher in a Tientsin school related that he once saw a dragon in his native province,
Shantung. The animal had been killed, so it was <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>believed, by the order of heaven, as a punishment for some misdeed, and had fallen
to the earth, where it lay as the center of attraction for hundreds of people who
came in crowds from that whole countryside. Its appearance was identical with that
of the popular pictures with which we are familiar. A school servant, who was also
a native of Shantung, and whose home was near the sea, declared that he once saw a
dragon. He told the writer that it was about fifteen feet long and that it fell to
the earth during a severe rainstorm. It, too, attracted a large crowd of spectators.
Although this man was unable to give very satisfactory details, yet his unusual earnestness
and apparent sincerity were convincing evidence that he had really seen a monster
of a remarkable type.
</p>
<p>A third person, an elderly gentleman, who is a teacher of classics in one of the schools
of Nanking, informed the writer that when he was a young man a dragon fell one night
from the sky and lay for twenty-four hours near his home. The country folk respectfully
covered it with matting, but he managed to raise the covering and saw its great cowlike
head, its four legs, and its scale-covered body. It was about fifty feet long and
blue in color. As in the other two cases, this dragon disappeared from the earth during
a <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>heavy storm. It was generally believed that it came to life again and was taken up
into the heavens upon a cloud, which formed beneath its body.
</p>
<p>The artist who drew the picture of the cloud dragon recounted that, during the thirty-fourth
year of the Emperor Kuang Hsu, while he himself was on his way to Peking to receive
the seals of a district magistrate, he came across a dragon lying upon the banks of
the Yellow River in Shantung province. It was blue in color and was several tens of
feet in length. The whole air was filled with a very offensive salt sea odor, and
out of respect for the creature, which was supposed to have fallen from heaven, the
crowd of people that stood around was busily engaged in sprinkling water upon its
body. The head resembled that of a cow and the artist said that except for the long
eyebrows the picture of the cloud dragon represented very faithfully what he actually
saw.
</p>
<p>Another Chinese has related that a business partner of his, while on a journey up
the Yangtze River, saw three dragons crossing a mountain range near the shore. Every
person on board was spellbound as they watched the three monsters—one yellow, another
white, and the third blue—as they majestically made their way with great <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>undulating strides up the mountain side. The dragons passed by so near the boat that
the observers saw every detail of their heads and the lacelike scales of their bodies.
The boat was respectfully stopped in mid-river, and only when the dragons had disappeared
over the ridge did the boatmen resume their task at the oars.
</p>
<p>Various stories have come to the writer, of dragons which have been seen either riding
upon banks of fog or dangling from passing clouds during great windstorms or rainstorms.
Invariably these have been described as having scale-covered bodies. One reasonable
explanation for the suspended dragons may be found in insipient tornadoes and water
spouts which never reach the ground. There seems, however, to be no explanation for
the dragon visits described by the five observers, unless it be that strange monsters
of the deep either crawled up out of the river and lay on the bank, in a dormant state,
or were sucked up by ocean- or river-water spouts, and when the columns of water broke
over the land the creatures were dropped far from their natural habitat. Two difficulties
at once present themselves to combat this hypothesis. The first of these is the improbability
that there are such creatures in existence, and the second difficulty <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>lies in the strangeness of their disappearance after coming to the earth. As a possible
explanation of the first difficulty, we wish to ask whether it is not possible that
there are still existing in the depths of the sea and in great rivers curious reptiles
and strange monsters such as no human beings now living have ever seen, the descendants
of the mighty saurians which lived upon the earth long ages ago, and which geologists
tell us later entered the sea, making that their more secretive habitat?

<p>As an explanation for the disappearance of the dragon in these three instances the
writer notes two facts. The dragons in each case were seen on the banks of great rivers
and in each case disappeared after a heavy rain. Might it not have been that the monsters
were in reality not dead but only unconscious, and that the heavy flood washed the
creatures back into the river whence they were carried out to sea?

<h2 class="main">THE DRAGON IN WESTERN MYTHOLOGY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dragon is not a conception of the Chinese mind alone. It also occupies a prominent
place in the legends and literature of most of the countries of Europe. Cicero in
his “<span lang="la">de Divinatione</span>” (Book II, line 30), Euripides in his “Philostratus” (Book I, line 2), and Homer
in the “Iliad” (Book II, line 309) all mention a dragon.
</p>
<p>The Bible, in twenty-two references in the Old Testament and thirteen instances in
the New, refers to the dragon either allegorically or as a real animal; however, in
many of these passages, especially in the Old Testament, the word “dragon” is an unfortunate
rendition, for in several places the writers of the Scriptures very evidently had
the conception of an animal that was in all probability the modern jackal.
</p>
<p>The myths and legends of Europe have preserved for us numerous dragon stories with
which we are more or less familiar. Among others are the tale of Perseus, who rescued
Andromeda from a dragon; the story of St. George and the <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>Dragon; the account of Sigfried, who killed a dragon at Worms; and the story of Beowulf,
who in the early days of history’s dawn dispatched a dragon after slaying Grendel.
</p>
<p>King Arthur, who was spoken of as the “dread Pendragon,” is described by Tennyson,
in his “Idylls of the King,” as sitting upon a veritable dragon throne which would
vie in splendor with that of China’s Manchu emperors. The vivid imagination of the
poet laureate gives us this picture:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“To his crown the golden dragon clung </p>
<p class="line">And down his robe the dragon writhed in gold </p>
<p class="line">And from the carven work behind him crept </p>
<p class="line">Two dragons gilded, sloping down to make </p>
<p class="line">Arms to his chair, while all the rest of them </p>
<p class="line">Through knots and loops and folds innumerable, </p>
<p class="line">Fled ever through the woodwork till they found </p>
<p class="line">The new design wherein they lost themselves.” </p>
</div>
<p class="first">Many coast and river cities of England, France, Italy, and Egypt still proudly recount
their local legends of cruel dragons which were slain, after battles royal, upon near-by
rivers or in adjacent seas. We may read of the Green Dragon of Mordiford, the Dragon
of Norwich, the Great Dragon of Pittempton, the Dragon of Naples, the Dragon of Arles,
the Dragon of Lyons, the Dragon of Marseilles, Sebec, the Dragon of the Nile, and
<span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>many more. These stories are proudly treasured as the sacred traditions of their respective
cities and countries.
</p>
<p>The Chinese conception of the dragon presents a very different creature from that
of the nations bordering on the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. It is true that there
are a few points of similarity, but there is only one to which we shall call attention
at this time. That is regarding its keenness of eyesight. Both types are endowed with
marvelous vision. The Chinese dragon is deaf and it is explained that its eyes, through
natural compensation, have attained an extraordinary power. His vision is so keen
that he can easily distinguish a blade of grass one hundred li away. In this connection
it is interesting to recall that the English word “dragon” is derived from the Greek
“<i lang="grc-latn">drakon</i>” (<span class="trans" title="drakōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">δράκων</span></span>), which means “to gaze” or “to see,” and the classics more than once refer to the
animal as “sharpsighted.”
</p>
<p>We do not know who first attached the English name “dragon” to the Chinese conception
“<i>lung</i>,” but it is hardly fair to the Oriental ruler of the sea to be branded with the stigma
which accompanies the English designation. Since the recent revolution, several devout
Westerners have been heard to express their great satisfaction that <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>the dragon flag has now forever disappeared. A misconception of the use of the word
“dragon” had caused the speakers to confuse the evil monster mentioned in the book
of Revelation with the animal so highly revered by the Chinese. The dragon of the
Chinese differs from the generally accepted Western idea in three striking particulars:
in appearance, in disposition, and in the regard in which it is held.
</p>
<p>In appearance, the European conception varies but slightly from the creature which
was its probable prototype, save for the addition of a pair of wings. The Chinese
species is developed to a higher degree. The latter has a more massive head from which
protrude two branching horns. This species, with the single exception of the Chih
Lung, or Li Lung, has no wings but travels from place to place upon the clouds.
</p>
<p>A still greater difference between the two varieties exists in the matter of disposition.
The European dragon is usually portrayed as a cruel monster, the personification of
all that is evil, and the enemy of man. Christian art represents it as opposed to
law, harmony, and progress and symbolic of sin and paganism. In this allegorical sense
it is painted in struggles with St. George, St. Michael, and St. Sylvester, who personified
<span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>Christianity and enlightenment. Saints and martyrs are pictured in the process of
crushing the dragon beneath their feet. The Chinese dragon, on the other hand, is
in this respect very nearly its antithesis. It is a beneficent creature, a friend
to man. It brings the rain which produces the crops that in turn supply his food.
</p>
<p>The third point of distinction between the two dragons lies in the esteem in which
it is held. The Western species was a horrible, loathesome creature, shunned and dreaded
by all mortals, while the Asiatic dragon is held in reverence and even worshiped by
the Chinese. This creature is in fact so highly revered that one of the most sacred
titles which was bestowed upon the emperors was “The True Dragon.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span></p>

<p class="first">Most representations of the dragon indicate peaceful, passive creatures. The artist
who designed this dragon for the garden of the emperors at Peking was a master of
his art. This graceful creature fairly throbs with life, and we almost hold our breath
as we look with the expectation that it will detach itself from the mural background
and launch out into space. It is a living thing, and we feel that in another moment
it will jerk back its head and rise to disappear before our very eyes. </p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>
<h2 class="main">QUAINT BELIEFS ABOUT THE DRAGON</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“The whiskers of the dragon,” according to a book of the Yuan dynasty, “are three
feet long and purple in color. If dragon whiskers are mounted upon a crystal handle
like a horsehair whip and are placed in a room at night, flies and mosquitoes will
not enter.” We are further informed that “if this instrument is swished through the
air it will make such a noise that chickens, dogs, cows, and horses on hearing it
will try to hide. If dragon whiskers are placed in deep water all scale-covered animals
will swim immediately to the spot, thinking that their master, the dragon, is there.”
</p>
<p>A strange fire plays about the body of the dragon. This differs from the fire with
which we are familiar in that it blazes brightly when brought into contact with water.
If, however, terrestrial fire touches the dragon flames, the latter will immediately
be extinguished.
</p>
<p>As long as the dragon has moisture in the form of water or clouds surrounding its
body, it <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>retains its marvelous powers of motion and of mutability, but when this moisture dries
up, the dragon becomes powerless and dies.
</p>
<p>It is said that the blood of some dragons is red; of others, black. Rubies are often
supposed to be petrified drops of the red variety.
</p>
<p>We are informed of the remarkable fact that dragons change their bones periodically
and as regularly as snakes shed their skins and deer their horns. Dragon bones are
supposed to be buried in many high mountains, and their presence has much to do with
the determination of fêng-shui. Lofty peaks that are frequently tipped with clouds
or enveloped in mist are believed to contain the bones of some great dragon which
attract to themselves the moisture of the passing clouds.
</p>
<p>The saliva of the dragon, we are told, is purple in color, and is considered the most
fragrant of all perfumes. It is said to be employed in the manufacture of a very valuable
incense. “Dragon’s saliva incense” was formerly sent as a tribute to the emperor by
one of the western provinces.
</p>
<p>One writer expresses a remarkable theory of the dragon’s posthumous state. He says
that when they die dragons turn into crabs. Dragons are punished for minor offenses,
according to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>will of heaven, by having their ears cut off; for greater offenses, by being sent
to the earth, where they are exposed to the view of men in a state as if dead.
</p>
<p>Three things of which dragons are exceedingly fond are bamboo trees, arsenic, and
the flesh of swallows. The graceful branches of the bamboo are very pleasing to the
eye of the dragon who, when there is no human being in sight, delights to lie under
their shade and hear the wind rustling the leaves above. Arsenic, which is to mortal
man a deadly poison, is food to the dragon. In fact, it is a favorite article of diet,
and dragons grow fat upon it. The delicacy, however, for which the dragon has the
greatest fondness, is swallows’ flesh. Woe to the man who ever tries to cross a body
of water in a boat after having eaten a dish of roasted swallows, for a peculiar fragrance,
which dragons are always able to detect, will cling to his person. The man in the
boat will be pursued by one of these animals, who will cause a storm to rise, the
boat will be upset, and the unfortunate person precipitated into the water, where
he will fall easy prey to the ruler of the sea. Under ordinary conditions the dragon
shows no fondness for human flesh, but with such provocation we are told that he should
be considered entirely excusable.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the autumnal equinox, according to one source, the majority of dragons descend
into the sea where they hibernate for six months. In fact, the home of dragons is
on the floor of the ocean where they dwell in beautiful palaces. At the vernal equinox
dragons leave the sea and ascend again into the clouds. Destructive typhoons and equinoctial
hurricanes along the coast, in the spring and autumn, are caused by the disturbance
of the waters when the great animals thus enter or leave their maritime home.

<p class="first">This insignia of rank was worn on a gown by the great statesman Li Hung Chung. All
Manchu officials carried, upon the front and the back of their robes of state, richly
embroidered squares like this. The gowns of civil officers bore pictures of birds,
while those of military officials had animals. Each of the nine ranks in both series
employed its own distinguishing emblem. The dragon was worn by the prime minister,
by princes, and the emperor. Li Hung Chang was prime minister of China for twenty
years. The threads are of gold and silver and the background is black satin. </p>

<h2 class="main">HOW DRAGONS CONTROL THE FORTUNES OF MEN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The surface of the earth is believed to be covered with a network of invisible paths
of the dragon known as Lung Mei. People who build their houses or find graves for
their dead upon one of these courses are extremely fortunate. The ruling emperors,
however, made efforts to prevent their subjects from occupying the positions upon
such auspicious sites. When Chao Ming, the founder of the Sung dynasty, while still
an unknown young man in reduced financial straits, was forced to move his father’s
bones, he carried them in a reed bag and buried them by accident upon one of these
dragon paths. As a result of this fact, we are told, heaven smiled upon him and he
himself not long afterward became an emperor.
</p>
<p>Within the past few years, a young Chinese, who had been studying in Japan, committed
suicide for political reasons while on his way across the ocean. Because he was so
well beloved he was buried by his friends in a beautiful mountain <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>valley on a dragon path. The Board of Rites in Peking, on hearing of this, ordered
the grave removed, sending telegram after telegram to the local magistrates to have
the coffin disinterred at once and taken to another spot. Since the Revolution, it
is said that the student’s body has been taken back to its first resting place.
</p>
<p>When Chinese observe the natural phenomenon which in the West is commonly described
as “the sun drawing up water,” they say that what is seen is the dragon sucking up
water to form the clouds.
</p>
<p>When rain falls upon one man’s field and not upon his neighbor’s, or upon one half
of a man’s farm and not upon the other, one explanation which is advanced for this
fact is that the line which marks the division of dry and wet land is directly beneath
the boundary line of the territory governed by two different dragons. One sees fit
to order rain when the other does not. The territories controlled by the different
dragons are redistributed once each year, on the seventeenth of the third month, which
is known as “Li Hsia,” “The Festival of the Beginning of Summer.”
</p>
<p>A few amusing illustrations of the way in which dragon superstitions have been allowed
to play a leading part in Chinese life have come to <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>the writer’s attention. A Tientsin district magistrate, about forty years ago, tried
to make an outlet from the Pei River in order to turn off the water at the time of
a flood. After spending too much money in what proved to be an unsuccessful effort,
he jumped into the river and was drowned. The story goes that the flood immediately
subsided and the official turned into a dragon. Shortly afterwards he was changed
into a snake and was captured. This creature was carried in state into Tientsin City
where it was placed in the dragon temple and was worshiped by the viceroy of Chihli
province, who was none other than Li Hung Chang. This official later became prime
minister and held that position for twenty years.
</p>
<p>In the heart of Wuchang there is a steep hill which cuts the business part of the
city into two sections. This hill is so steep that it is practically impossible to
carry the traffic over it. Some Chinese claim the hill to be the dwelling place of
a tortoise, others of a serpent, and still others of a dragon. Some years ago, when
Chang Chih Tung was living in that city as viceroy of Hunan and Hupeh, he caused a
tunnel to be cut through the hill so that communication from one business center to
the other would be facilitated. Not long after this was completed, the viceroy began
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>suffer from a carbuncle on his neck. Chinese and foreign physicians alike failed in
their attempts to cure him. At last a geomancer was consulted. “I know the reason
for your Excellency’s illness,” he said without hesitation. “You have caused the dragon’s
haunt to be penetrated. Block up the tunnel in the hill and you will get well.” The
thing was done, the viceroy soon recovered, and faith in the dragon on the part of
the people of Wuchang was more firmly established than ever. It might be added that
since the Revolution the tunnel through the hill has again been opened.
</p>
<p>Many years ago large numbers of the students of Hangchow City failed to pass the Chu
Jen, or Master of Arts, Examination. The fact sorely puzzled the city magistrates,
who lost much “face.” No explanation could be found for this fact until a geomancer
explained that a dragon living in the mountain range northwest of the city had no
room to wag his head, and that a large section of one end of the range must be dug
away before Hangchow students would be able to succeed. The geomancer’s suggestion
was carried out, the dragon was given the chance he desired, and it is needless to
say that since that time all has been well.

dragon lanterns were not infrequently seventy-five to one hundred feet in length.
These were supported by from twenty-five to thirty men. Occasionally those lanterns
were used at other times of the year, more particularly on the fifth of the fifth
month of the lunar calendar, a holiday known as the “Dragon Boat Festival.” </p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The word “dragon” occupies a prominent place in the common phraseology of the country.
Some illustrations of this fact are as follows:
</p>
<p>Deaf people are called “<i>lung</i>,” a character formed by the combination of the dragon and ear characters signifying
a person with ears like a dragon (which we are informed is deaf).
</p>
<p>The asparagus plant is known as “dragon’s beard grass.”
</p>
<p>The gentian flower is called the “dragon’s gall.”
</p>
<p>A common variety of pine is known as “dragon’s tail pine,” from the supposed similarity
of its branches to the tail of the dragon.
</p>
<p>Amaryllis lilies and also the blossoms of a certain locust tree are called “dragon’s
claw flowers.” This is no doubt on account of the shape of the flower clusters.
</p>
<p>Fire engines are called “water dragons.”
</p>
<p>Locomotives and water faucets are commonly designated as “dragon heads.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>The keel of a ship goes by the name of the “dragon bone.”
</p>
<p>Water spouts are known as “dangling dragons.” The name was probably given them by
junkmen and fishermen who considered these to be the tails of dragons suspended from
the clouds.
</p>
<p>Spirited horses are said to have “dragon dispositions.”
</p>
<p>Betrothal certificates are known as “dragon-phœnix papers.”
</p>
<p>Wedding cakes are called “dragon-phœnix cakes.”
</p>
<p>The published list of Master of Arts graduates was known as the “Dragon-Tiger Register.”
</p>
<p>A large number of cities, prefectures, rivers, and mountains have the character “dragon”
incorporated into their names. One of the largest rivers of Manchuria and one of its
three provinces are named Hei Lung Kiang (Black Dragon River), because it is related
that a large black dragon once made its appearance in its waters.
</p>
<p>One of the most famous mountains of the province of Kiangsi is known as the “Dragon-Tiger
Mountain.”

<p class="first">Situated four or five miles west of the city of Hangchow is the center of the district
that gives its name to what is perhaps the most famous tea in China. This is known
as the “Lung Ching.” The tea takes its name from a pool of water called “The Dragon
Well.” The walls of a monastery now surround the pool. This photograph shows the entrance
to the temple grounds. The two characters over the arch form one of the best-known
names in all China. </p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb58b">[<a href="#pb58b">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>Perhaps the most popular kind of tea in China is the “Dragon’s Well Tea.” This received
its designation from the fact that its original home <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>was in a valley of that name. Among the hills on the farther shores of Hangchow’s
beautiful West Lake is nestled a monastery, on the estate of which is a pool of crystal-clear
water. From the depths of this “well” a dragon was once seen to rise. The “Dragon’s
Well” is now the name of the monastery and also of the surrounding hills. Tea of this
name, though it may never have grown near Hangchow, is as highly prized in distant
Szechwan and in other distant parts of China as it is in the capital of Chekiang province.
</p>
<p>In the excellent new encyclopedia recently issued by the Commercial Press, there are
no less than 257 references to the dragon. Fifty-one of these are the names of cities
or villages, twenty-four of mountains and rivers, and fifteen the names of flora of
various genera.
</p>
<p>The emperor’s most reverential title was “The True Dragon,” and in harmony with that
idea the word “dragon” in the adjectival sense was used in names of all that had to
do with his life and position. As an example of this his throne was the “dragon’s
seat,” his hands the “dragon’s claws,” the pen he used was the “dragon’s brush,” the
imperial robes were called “dragon’s garments,” and the imperial glance was known
as “dragon’s eyes.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>The “Dragon Tablet” was the name given to the imperial tablet, which was worshiped
during the Ching dynasty in every large temple and monastery in the land, and even
in Mohammedan mosques. The inscription on the tablet read as follows: “To the reigning
Emperor. May he live ten thousand years, ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten
thousand years.” The tablet received its name from the fact that it represented the
Emperor, “The True Dragon,” and because it bore at its top a dragon’s head.
</p>
<p>One insignia of official rank, until the recent Revolution, was the picture-square
embroidered in gold and silver thread and worn on the front and back of official robes.
The squares worn by civil officers bore the pictures of birds, while those of military
officials were decorated with the pictures of animals; each rank and grade having
its corresponding variety of bird or beast. The emperor, the princes, and the prime
minister were allowed the special privilege of wearing the dragon on one of these
embroidered squares.

<p class="first">During the Manchu dynasty, practically every Buddhist and Taoist temple of any size
had an imperial dragon tablet in a prominent place upon the altar. Usually this stood
before the image. The words it bore were these: “To the reigning emperor. May he live
ten thousand years, ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years.” In
the gilded decoration about the characters three dragons twine themselves. Many such
tablets may still be seen, although China has now been a Republic for ten years. This
photograph was taken in Hangchow in March, 1922. The tablet stands on the altar in
the Temple of the Great Buddha, which is situated upon the north edge of the West
Lake. </p>

<p class="first">This copy of an old engraving depicts a huge “dragon boat” passing gracefully up the
Min River at Foochow. Twoscore rowers paddle the long craft, which glides swiftly
up the river to the weird music of drums and gongs. </p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb62b">[<a href="#pb62b">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>The round disk on the Chinese Dragon Flag, which is often pictured before the mouth
of the dragon, is explained by some as a pearl, by others as a huge spider metamorphosed
into a ball. We are repeatedly told in fables that dragons have a <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>peculiar fondness for teasing spiders. A more satisfactory theory, however, is that
the disk represents the sun. According to this explanation, the dragon is not trying
to devour that heavenly body, as some would lead us to suppose, but is gazing with
a great longing, for it desires to become like the sun in brilliance.
</p>
<p>In referring to the Dragon Flag, the fact is worthy of notice that although this design
appeared upon Chinese military banners through many centuries, the selection of the
dragon emblem as a national insignia was of comparatively recent date. It is probable
that the custom of foreign nations of using national emblems had a large part to play
with the adoption of a national flag.
</p>
<p>There is a feeling among many friends of China, and even among a few Chinese as well,
that the effect of the Revolution and the passing of the Dragon Flag will very shortly
kill out the dragon idea. This the writer believes is impossible. A belief that has
gripped the nation for over forty centuries is not to be shaken even by a great revolution,
which, though cataclysmic in itself, yet in relation to the ages which have passed,
is little more than a ripple upon the surface of the sea of time. The dragon is neither
<span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>a symbol of the Manchu dynasty nor a type of absolute monarchy, and has nothing in
common with either. The idea is distinctly a heritage of the Chinese race itself,
and as such it will probably live as long as this people. It will survive at least
until a generation after Western science has permeated and dominated every seaside
village, every mountain hamlet, and every inland city, to the remotest bounds and
limits of this vast Republic.

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
